# Getting and Cleaning Data - Peer-graded Assignment

This repository contains the files required for the peer-graded assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data course by Coursera. The **data.table** package needs to be installed to use the script.

The following files belong to this assignment:
* README.md - this README-File with information about the project
* CodeBook.md - describes the variables, the data and transformations that have been performed to clean up the data
* run_analysis.R - R Script that does all the work (download dataset, tidy data and calculate result values)

## Instructions

1. Checkout the repository using git
2. Load your R environment (e.g. RStudio)
3. Set working directory to the checked out directory
4. Open script run_analysis.R and start the script
5. No more step is required, as the script downloads the dataset, unpacks it and processes its content according to the assignment

## Dataset

The analyzed dataset is from the area of wearable computing.
Further information about the dataset (and the dataset itself) can be found here: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
